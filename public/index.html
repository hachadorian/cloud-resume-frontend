                <div>
                    Work as a Frontend Developer, where I build and design web applications using React/Gatsby,
                    developing data-driven pages through REST API endpoints and integrating content from a headless CMS.
                    I serve as the project coordinator for new web applications, ensuring they meet accessibility
                    standards (WCAG) and utilizing Figma for wireframing and mockups. I also maintain legacy codebases
                    built with ASP.Net, C#, and Vanilla HTML/JS, developing features to enhance older projects and
                    integrating modern build tools to streamline development. Additionally, I oversee daily Content
                    Management System (CMS) operations, manage site content, assist users with registration, and created
                    training resources for new staff. I also contribute to the development of Ansible playbooks and
                    roles.

                <div>This was my first experience having to work with a client to
                    deliver an end product. It was a great learning experience. I learned a ton
                    about working within a team and client relations. The application was for
                    LNPWI for tracking data surrounding public housing residents. We worked in sprints
                    and had daily scrum meetings where we would rotate scrum master. Along with
                    development we created documentation for the end user and deployed the application
                    on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and also Amazon's RDS service for the database.</div>

                <div>
                    This project was apart of a challenge from devChallenges.io. The backend server was created with
                    NodeJS,
                    apollo-server-express and Graphql and the
                    frontend was made with ReactJS and TailwindCSS. I also used redis for session management and
                    Nodemailer
                    for sending emails to users. The backend is deployed on Heroku and for the frontend I used AWS
                    amplify.
                    I also used AWS' s3 service for storing and retrieving profile pictures.</div>

                    <h3 class="my-2">Group Chat</h3>
                    <div>Project apart of a challenge on devChallenges.io. The challenge was to create a web application
                        similar
                        to
                        Discord but without voice chat. I developed the backend using apollo-server-express and nodejs.
                        Also
                        integrated AWS'
                        s3 service
                        to store and serve profile pictures. Utilized apollo server subscriptions to display updates to
                        all
                        users.
                        Implemented offset
                        pagination when displaying messages within a channel. The authentication was the same as a prior
                        project
                        so
                        I used
                        Redis
                        to store a server-side cookie for session management. I also was able to get socketio working on
                        localhost
                        to where
                        it showed
                        when a user was typing in a specific channel but had some difficulties with getting socketio to
                        work
                        when
                        deployed
                        on Heroku. Users can create
                        channels, join channels, search for channels, and send and receive messages.</div>
