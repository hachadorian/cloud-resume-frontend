            <h1 class="my-2">Capstone Project - PHA Cares Tracker</h1>
            <div>This was my first experience having to work with a client to
                deliver an end product. It was a great learning experience. I learned a ton
                about working within a team and client relations. The application was for
                LNPWI for tracking data surrounding public housing residents. We worked in sprints
                and had daily scrum meetings where we would rotate scrum master. Along with
                development we created documentation for the end user and deployed the application
                on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and also Amazon's RDS service for the database.</div>

            <h1>Instagram Clone</h1>
            <div>This was my final project for a class in server-side development.
                Designed website using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap; developed a RESTful API for most of
                the functionality; SOAP API for direct messaging; designed data model/database
                and implemented stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.</div>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mb-5">Fullstack Javascript Authentication</h1>
            <div>Since graduation I have shifted my focus more towards front-end
                development with Javascript and also learning fullstack Javascript development.
                This project was apart of a challenge from devChallenges.io. The backend server was created with NodeJS,
                apollo-server-express and Graphql and the
                frontend was made with ReactJS and TailwindCSS. I also used redis for session management and Nodemailer
                for sending emails to users. The backend is deployed on Heroku and for the frontend I used AWS amplify.
                I also used AWS' s3 service for storing and retrieving profile pictures.</div>
            <div class="my-2">Frontend: ReactJS, TailwindCSS</div>
            <div class="my-2">Backend: NodeJS, GraphQL, Redis, Postgres</div>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mb-5">Twitch Musicplayer</h1>
            <div>Project that I have been working on for a short amount of time. It is a music player that was
                meant to be integrated with Twitch to create a small community where streamers wouldn't have to worry
                about
                copyright claims
                related to playing music on stream. For the login I integrated Twitch's OAuth and for session management
                I used
                redis to store a cookie on the server-side. The backend
                server uses NodeJS, apollo-server-express and GraphQL and the frontend uses ReactJS and TailwindCSS. I
                also
                used AWS' Cloudfront to set up a CDN to deliver the mp3 files to play. I think the idea could maybe be
                useful but if
                I do end up
                finishing this project I may integrate soundcloud as cost of Cloudfront
                and delivering mp3s can become pretty costly.</div>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mb-5">IP Tracker</h1>
            <div>Project apart of a challenge on FrontendMentor.io. The challenge was to create a web application that
                allows users to search domains or ip addresses and see where exactly they are on a map. For finding the
                location
                of ip addresses we had to use geo.ipify.org and for the map we had to use leaflet. I ended up having to
                also make a
                backend for the application. I ended up making a small nodejs express server to make requests to the ip
                api to get
                around cors. The backend and frontend are both deployed on Heroku.</div>
            <div class="my-2">Frontend: ReactJS, TailwindCSS</div>
            <div class="my-2">Backend: NodeJS, Express</div>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mb-5">Group Chat</h1>
            <div>Project apart of a challenge on devChallenges.io. The challenge was to create a web application similar
                to
                Discord but without voice chat. I developed the backend using apollo-server-express and nodejs. Also
                integrated AWS'
                s3 service
                to store and serve profile pictures. Utilized apollo server subscriptions to display updates to all
                users.
                Implemented offset
                pagination when displaying messages within a channel. The authentication was the same as a prior project
                so
                I used
                Redis
                to store a server-side cookie for session management. I also was able to get socketio working on
                localhost
                to where
                it showed
                when a user was typing in a specific channel but had some difficulties with getting socketio to work
                when
                deployed
                on Heroku. Users can create
                channels, join channels, search for channels, and send and receive messages.</div>
